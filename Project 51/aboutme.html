    <h1>About Origami Studio.</h1>

    <p style="font-family:courier;">Origami Studio was an initatitve made by
    Honey. We started as a small project for a college art assignment.
But soon, Origami Studio had 2 members, Honey's friends. Slowly,it grew and by the time
Honey graduated, Origami Studio had 30 members and 15 frequent customers. Now, Origami Studio
is a forum for Origami artists to sell and share their work. It is also used for birthday parties
and learning the Japenese art of Origami through proffessionals! </p>
